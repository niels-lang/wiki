Everyone else seems to have a language named after them, and now I have too.

## What

I made a programming language because I dislike the Lua syntax but like the speed and flexibility. The syntax is basically stolen from Rust and OOC, though to make it unique and hipster I have also put in a lot of sugar and a weird type system that in no way fits the Rust idioms.

Have fun.

## Why

Now I can make games, AI, libraries and hacky scripts while feeling proud and hipster all at once.
